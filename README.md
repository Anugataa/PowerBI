# PowerBI
Successfully completed fellowship program for Microsoft Power BI development where I have acquired some real time expertise on the Data Cleaning, visualization with powerful dashboards using Power BI desktop.
#########
 I have used the Superstore dataset for my first POwerBI dashboard creation in the guidance of Growth School.
 I have created two dashboards in total. One with the overview of the data and the other one with product sales details.
 The first dash board "Overview" dashboard includes - total sales, total profit, total amount of products sold, along with Products sold by region, city and segments. We also have filters to further check products sold in different sub categories within a specific given period of time.
 The second dash board "Product Sales" we have calculated values of total sales, total profit, total amount of products sold, along with information of each and every product listed. We can select a product ID here and see the amount of product sold by region, by city, the profits of that particular product in different cities. We can also check state/city specifically to monitor the previously mentioned stats.
